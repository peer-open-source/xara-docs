Parallel3D Wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command is used to construct a Parallel3D material. 
It is a wrapper that imposes an iso-strain condition to an arbitrary number of previously-defined 3D nDMaterial objects. 
Therefore, in each sub-material the strains are equal, the parallel stress and tangent are equal to the (weighted) sum of those of the sub-materials.

   $tag1 $tag2 ... $tagN, N |integer|, "unique tags identifying previously defined nD materials"
   $w1 $w2 ... $wN, N |float|, "weight factors, optional. If not defined, they will be assumed all equal to 1"

.. admonition:: Responses

   * All responses available for the nDMaterial object: **stress** (or **stresses**), **strain** (or **strains**), **tangent** (or **Tangent**), **TempAndElong**.
   * **material** **$matId** ... : use the **material** keyword followed by the 1-based index of the sub-material (and followed by the desired response) to forward the request to the matId sub-material.
   * **homogenized** ... : use the **homogenized** keyword followed by the desired response to forward the request to all sub-materials, and to compute its weighted average.
