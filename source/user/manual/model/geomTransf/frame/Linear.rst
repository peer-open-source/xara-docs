Linear
^^^^^^

A *Linear* coordinate transformation performs a linear geometric transformation of a :ref:`Frame <Frame>` element's response from a basic system to the global coordinate system.

Theory
------

Orientation 
===========

The longitudinal basis vector :math:`\mathbf{i}` is derived from the two element end nodes. 
The vector **vecxz** is a vector the user specifies that must not be parallel to this axis. 
The x-axis along with the **vecxz** Vector define the xz plane. 
The local y-axis is defined by taking the cross product of the x-axis vector and the **vecxz** vector (:math:`\mathbf{i}_y = i_{xz} \times \mathbf{i}`). 
The local z-axis is then found by taking the cross product of the y-axis and x-axis vectors (:math:`\mathbf{i}_z = \mathbf{i} \times \mathbf{i}_y`). 
The section is attached to the element such that the y-z coordinate system used to specify the section corresponds to the y-z axes of the element.


.. note::

   When in 2D, local x and y axes are in the X-Y plane, where X and Y are global axes. 
   Local x axis is the axis connecting the two element nodes, and local y and z axes follow the right-hand rule (e.g., if the element is aligned with the positive Y axis, the local y axis is aligned with the negative X axis, and if the element is aligned with the positive X axis, the local y axis is aligned with the positive Y axis). 
   Orientation of local y and z axes is important for the definition of the :ref:`ShearFiber` section.

Joint Offsets
=============

Joint offsets are specified with respect to the global coordinate system.

Example
-------

In the following example *Linear* transformations are defined

1. **Tcl Code**

   .. code-block:: tcl

	# Element 1 : tag 1 : vecxZ = zaxis
	geomTransf Linear 1 0 0 -1

	# Element 2 : tag 2 : vecxZ = y axis
	geomTransf Linear 2 0 1 0

	# If there was a rigid offset at the top of element 1:
	geomTransf Linear 1 0 0 -1 -jntOffset 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 -$Offset 0.0


2. **Python Code**

   .. code-block:: python
   
	# Element 1, vecxZ = z-axis
	model.geomTransf("Linear", 1, (0, 0, -1))

	# Element 2, vecxZ = y-axis
	model.geomTransf("Linear", 2, (0, 1,  0))

	# If there was a rigid offset at the top of element 1: (offset is a variable that the offset value has been stored in)
	model.geomTransf("Linear", 3, (0, 0, -1), "-jntOffset",0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, offset, 0.0)
