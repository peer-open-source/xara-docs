Poromechanics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The equations governing the interaction of the solid and fluid media were first established for quasi-static phenomena in 1941 by Biot [1]_ who then extended them to dynamics. ${ }^{2-4}$ 
At a later date so called 'mixture' theory introduced in 1957 by Truesdell [5]_ [6]_ and elaborated by many others [7]_ - [13]_ provided a new basis for such coupled equations and a rederivation of the equations was achieved with no substantial or rational change resulting.
