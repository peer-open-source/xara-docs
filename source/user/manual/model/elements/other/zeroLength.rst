ZeroLength
^^^^^^^^^^

A ZeroLength element is defined by two nodes at the same location. 
A ZeroLength element is similar to a set of springs placed between two nodes, each spring providing the force displacement relationship for a specified degree-of-freedom. 
The nodes are connected by multiple UniaxialMaterials, which provide the force-deformation relationship for the element in that degree-of-freedom direction.

         Construct a zero-length element.

         :param integer tag: tag identifying element
         :param nodes: tuple of two integers representing the tags of the end nodes
         :param mat: tuple of integers representing the tags of previously-defined :ref:`UniaxialMaterial <UniaxialMaterial>` objects
         :param dir: tuple of integers representing the degree-of-freedom directions for each material (1, 2, 3 for translation along local x, y, z axes; 4, 5, 6 for rotation about local x, y, z axes)

.. note::

   If the optional orientation vectors are not specified, the local element axes coincide with the global axes. Otherwise the local z-axis is defined by the cross product between the vectors x and yp vectors specified on the command line.

   The valid queries to a zero-length element when creating an ElementRecorder object are 'force,' 'deformation,' and 'material $i matArg1 matArg2 ...' Where $i is an integer indicating which of the materials whose data is to be output (a 1 corresponds to $matTag1, a 2 to $matTag2, and so on). 


.. warning::

   If the distance between end noes is not **0.0** a warning will be issued. ZeroLength elements can be used between nodes with non-zero length.


Examples
--------

The following examples demonstrate the commands in a script to add three zeroLength elements to domain. 
The three to be added have element tags **1**, **2**, and **3**. 
Element **1** has nodes **2** and **3** as its end ndes, has two materials **5** and **6** acting in directions **1** and **2**. 
Element **2** has as its end nodes **4** and **5**, has only one material **1** acting in direction **1**, the element has a global orientation.

   .. code-block:: tcl

      element zeroLength 1 2 4 -mat 5 6 -dir 1 2
      element zeroLength 2 4 5 -mat 1 -dir 1 -orient 1 1 0 -1 1 0
      element zeroLength 3 5 6 -mat 1 -dir 1 -doRayleigh 1

2. **Python Code**

   .. code-block:: python

      model.element("zeroLength",1,2,4,"-mat",(5,6),"-dir",1,2)
      model.element("zeroLength",2,4,5,"-mat",1,"-dir",1,"-orient",1,1,0,-1,1,0)
      model.element("zeroLength",3,5,6,"-mat",1,"-dir",1,"-doRayleigh",1)

   .. note::

      The penalty stiffness should be chosen large enough to approximate a rigid constraint, but not so large that it causes numerical conditioning problems. 
      A typical value is 1.0e10 times the characteristic stiffness of the structure. The orientation vectors define the local coordinate system of the zeroLength element, allowing the constraint to be applied in the desired direction (normal to the skewed support).
