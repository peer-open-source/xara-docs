Meshing
^^^^^^^

The *Meshing* methods are used to automatically generate a structured mesh of elements and nodes through simple subdivition of basic geometric shapes.
For more complicated *unstructured* meshes, external meshing tools such as Gmsh or TetGen can be used to generate the mesh and then read into Xara.
