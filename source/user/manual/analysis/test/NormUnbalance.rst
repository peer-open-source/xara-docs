.. _NormUnbalance:

NormUnbalance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command is used to construct a convergence test which uses the norm of the right hand side of the matrix equation, i.e. :math:`b` vector in :math:`Ax=b`, to determine if convergence has been reached. 
What the right-hand-side of the matrix equation is depends on integrator and constraint handler chosen. 
Usually, though not always, it is equal to the equilibrium residual.

         | 2 print information on norms and number of iterations at end of successful test
         | 4 at each step it will print the norms and also the <math>\Delta U</math> and <math>R(U)</math> vectors.
         | 5 if it fails to converge at end of $numIter it will print an error message BUT RETURN A SUCCESSFUL test."
         $nType, |integer|, "type of norm (optional: default is 2 (0 = max-norm 1 = 1-norm 2 = 2-norm ...))"


.. note::

   When using a :ref:`penalty` constraint handler, large forces (those necessary to enforce the constraint) are included in the :math:`b` vector. Even for very small changes in the displacement, if user has selected overly large penalty factor, large forces can appear in the :math:`b` vector.


Examples
--------

The following examples demonstrate the command to create a ``NormUnbalance`` test which allows ``10`` iterations with a 2-norm in the residual :math:`b` vector, i.e. :math:`\sqrt(b \cdot b)` of **1.0e-2**.
