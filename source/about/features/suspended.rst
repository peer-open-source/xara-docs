Suspended
^^^^^^^^^

Certain features of OpenSees have been *suspended* for development of OpenSeesRT, but are planned to be re-implemented in the near future. 
These features include:

* Save and restore of the model state. Motivation: the existing implementation is considered error prone and unmaintainable due to its reliance on hard-coded integer class tags and global interpreter variables.
