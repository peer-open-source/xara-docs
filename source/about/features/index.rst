Features
^^^^^^^^

Xara offers several advanced features that make it a powerful tool for nonlinear finite element analysis:

- **Mixed Formulations**: It supports mixed formulations for beams and solids, enabling accurate modeling of complex structural systems.
- **Extensive Material Models**: With over 200 material models, Xara provides flexibility for simulating various materials and their nonlinear behaviors.
- **Continuation Algorithms**: These algorithms are designed to solve highly nonlinear problems efficiently, making Xara suitable for challenging engineering scenarios.
- **Stateless Modeling**: Xara introduces a `Model` class for true stateless modeling, allowing users to work without relying on a single global program state.
- **Compatibility Layer**: It reproduces OpenSeesPy functions, ensuring seamless integration for users familiar with the OpenSees ecosystem.
- **Performance Optimization**: Built on the OpenSeesRT framework, Xara delivers substantial performance improvements over traditional interpreters.
