Deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following features of OpenSeesPy are currently supported, but are highly discouraged:

* Section subcommands (``fiber``, ``patch`` and ``layer``) without an explicit ``section`` argument.

* Pattern subcommands (:meth:`Model.load`, :meth:`Model.eleLoad`) without an explicit ``pattern`` argument.
